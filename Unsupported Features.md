If [Update Disabler Extreme](https://github.com/QuakedK/Update-Disabler/releases/download/Winupdatedisabler/Update-Disabler-Extreme-V1.2.bat) was done, then restoring manually within Windows doesn't work. However System Restore points can be used in Advanced Recovery allowing it to work, follow the tutorial below. 

**Work Around:** 

&nbsp;1. Hold Shift and click Restart.

&nbsp;2. Once in Advanced Recovery, click Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options -> System Restore

> [!NOTE]
> If [Update Disabler Lite](https://github.com/QuakedK/Update-Disabler/releases/download/Winupdatedisabler/Update-Disabler-Lite-V1.2.bat) was done then, System Restoring the normal way will work.
